# Metrics & Limitations

This document outlines how results in GenXAiP simulations should be interpreted.

## Metrics (Exploratory)

GenXAiP simulations may visualize or track:

- Structural coherence over time
- Convergence behavior under noise
- Drift magnitude and recovery time
- Relative latency masking effectiveness
- Reconstruction stability

These metrics are qualitative or comparative.
They are not benchmarks.

## Limitations

- Simulation-only environment
- No real-time networking stack
- No hardware assumptions
- No performance guarantees
- No claims of optimality or superiority

## Interpretation Guidance

Results should be used for:

- Research discussion
- Visualization
- Conceptual comparison
- Hypothesis generation

Not for:

- Deployment decisions
- Performance claims
- Competitive evaluation

Tested, not believed.
