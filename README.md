## Generation X-Wave Artificial Internodal Protocol

GenXAiP is a software-based research and simulation platform for exploring structure-first coordination, coherence, and reconstruction under constrained communication models.

The system investigates how structure can be transmitted, detected, and reconstructed in noisy environments using minimal signaling, memory, and statistical convergence — without assuming meaning, decoding, or semantics.

## What GenXAiP Is

- A simulation and instrumentation platform  
- A collection of interactive experimental applications  
- A framework for studying structure, coherence, and latency masking  
- A sandbox for gaming, VR, anomaly detection, and coordination research

## What GenXAiP Is Not

- Not a physical networking protocol  
- Not a replacement for the internet  
- Not encryption, messaging, or signal decoding  
- Not a claim of new physics
