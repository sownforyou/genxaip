# Simulation Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions used across GenXAiP simulations and experimental profiles.

These assumptions are explicit, intentional, and subject to change. They exist to bound interpretation and avoid unintended real-world claims.

---

## General Assumptions

- All systems are simulated
- No physical layer is modeled
- No real-time guarantees are implied
- No production networking stack is implemented
- No biological, physiological, or neurological claims are made

---

## Signal & Structure Assumptions

- Structure may be represented abstractly (graphs, patterns, state transitions)
- Noise is synthetic and parameterized
- Timing gaps and silence are modeled statistically, not physically
- Reconstruction is evaluated by convergence metrics, not semantic accuracy

---

## Latency & Coordination Assumptions

- Latency masking is simulated via prediction and structure alignment
- Fairness is evaluated comparatively, not absolutely
- Drift tolerance is bounded and resettable
- Synchronization is logical, not clock-accurate

---

## Energy & Efficiency Assumptions

- Energy-per-bit comparisons are relative
- No hardware power models are assumed
- Efficiency claims are exploratory and contextual

---

## What This Does NOT Assume

- New physics
- Violation of known limits
- Guaranteed scalability
- Superiority to existing protocols
- Deployability without engineering validation

---

All results are exploratory.

Tested, not believed.
