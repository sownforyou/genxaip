# GenXAiP Simulations

This directory contains standalone simulation experiments used to explore
structure transmission, coherence buildup, latency masking, and reconstruction
under constrained and noisy conditions.

## Purpose
- Visualize system behavior
- Explore parameter sensitivity
- Compare convergence vs noise and gap density
- Support discussion and iteration

## Scope
- Simulation-only
- No real-world performance claims
- No hardware assumptions

## Example Experiments (planned)
- Coherence vs time under noise
- Gap density vs convergence rate
- Energy-per-bit comparisons (relative)
- Latency masking behavior

Results are exploratory.

Tested, not believed.
