# GenXAiP VR Profile

This document describes a simulated virtual reality coordination profile explored within the GenXAiP platform.

## Purpose
To study how predictive structure, coherence buildup, and latency masking affect immersion, stability, and user experience in VR-like environments.

## Scope
- Simulation-only
- No real-time hardware or display claims
- No guarantees of perceptual or physiological outcomes

## Concepts Explored
- Predictive coherence for frame continuity
- Structure-first world reconstruction
- Drift tolerance and resynchronization
- Latency masking through structural anticipation
- Focus-dependent resolution

## Intended Use
Research, visualization, and discussion of coordination and reconstruction strategies in virtual environments.

Tested, not believed.
