# GenXAiP Gaming Profile

This document describes a simulated gaming coordination profile explored within the GenXAiP platform.

## Purpose

To study how shared structure, predictive coherence, and latency masking affect fairness and synchronization in interactive systems under variable network conditions.

## Scope

- Simulation-only
- No real-time networking claims
- No performance guarantees

## Concepts Explored

- Latency masking via structural prediction
- Coherence convergence over time
- Fairness under asymmetric delay
- Drift tolerance and resynchronization

## Intended Use

Research, visualization, and discussion of coordination strategies in gaming-like environments.

Tested, not believed.
