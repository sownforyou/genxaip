# GenXAiP Autonomy / Drone Profile

This document describes a simulated autonomy and coordination profile explored within the GenXAiP platform.

## Purpose
To study how distributed agents maintain coordination, structure, and coherence under partial information, noise, and loss.

## Scope
- Simulation-only
- No physical robotics or flight control claims
- No real-world safety guarantees

## Concepts Explored
- Structure-first coordination
- Coherence buildup across agents
- Loss tolerance and graceful degradation
- Retrodictive reconstruction of shared state
- Resynchronization after dropout

## Intended Use
Research, visualization, and discussion of coordination strategies in autonomous or swarm-like systems.

Tested, not believed.
