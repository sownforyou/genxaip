# Autonomy / Drone Profile

This profile explores coordinated structure and coherence under loss in autonomous and distributed systems.

Scope:
- Simulation-only
- No real-world control claims
- Emphasis on coordination, not command

Planned topics:
- Structure persistence under dropout
- Coordinated convergence
- Loss-tolerant signaling

Tested, not believed.
