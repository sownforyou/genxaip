# VR Profile

This profile explores predictive coherence and temporal alignment in virtual and mixed reality environments.

Scope:
- Simulation-only
- Focus on perceptual continuity
- No hardware assumptions

Planned topics:
- Temporal drift tolerance
- Predictive stabilization
- Coherence under jitter

Tested, not believed.
