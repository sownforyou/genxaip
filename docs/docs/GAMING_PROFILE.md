# Gaming Profile

This profile explores latency masking, fairness, and coherence in interactive gaming environments.

Scope:
- Simulation-only
- No production networking claims
- Focus on relative behavior under latency and loss

Planned topics:
- Latency masking vs true latency
- Fairness under asymmetric delay
- Predictive coherence windows

Tested, not believed.
